% Personal Statement
\section*{SUMMARY}
My role as my company's first hire was to devise product strategy for a driving simulation and behavioural research service, beginning from a blank sheet of paper. This work led to signing the UK Government's first framework agreement for use of immersive technology and our working across Government and the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector.

I have enjoyed creating an environment where colleagues can express themselves and work with freedom towards applications that have supported Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs), foreign engagement and public policy, through the delivery of Digital Twins, interactive visualisations, and driver-in-the-loop simulation.
